# Noisy Animals Kata

Install noisy animals:

```
bundle install
```

Then see the tests demonstrate how noisy the animals are:

```
bundle exec rspec
```

## The exercise
This small exercise is designed to help thinking about and improve code.

The NoisyAnimal class has some poor code in it. Can you spot and fix some problems?

### New requirements are so great!
When/If you're feeling comfortable with the code, try adding these animals:

- A snake that makes the noise "hiss" when it is loud and "slither" when it is not loud
- A mouse that is so silent that it outputs only one blank line, whether loud or quiet

Support the `true` or `false` values for the `is_loud` flag in both cases.

Don't forget the tests for your new requirements! Don't change any existing tests.

## Self reflection before you start
- What problems can you identify if you think for 5 minutes before you start changing code?
- What sort of changes do you think will address these problems?

## Self reflection after trying to make changes
- Does your starting list of problems still feel complete?
- If you rewrote the list now, would it be different? How and why?
- Does your current assessment of the NoisyAnimal problems feel similar or different to other code you read or work with?
- Have you found yourself trying something and then realising it wouldn't work? How easy was it to get back to something that did work?
- Do you make git commits as you make your changes?
- How often do you run the tests? What if you could only run them once every 10 minutes? Or 30 minutes?
- What would it take to run the tests every time you changed a line of `noisy_animal.rb`?
- Is it easier to add the new animals before or after addressing some of the problems?
