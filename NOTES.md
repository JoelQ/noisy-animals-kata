# Notes

## Before starting

- Domain concepts: animals, noise, loudness
- Problems:
  - To many different ways of doing the same thing
  - Mix of dependent and independent conditionals
  - Boolean control coupling flag `is_loud`
- Changes that can make improvements
  - Use a single approach to doing the various conditionals
  - Make the animal and bird noise code more similar
  - Extract polymporphic animal classes
